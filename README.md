# Psychedelics-and-Vision

This repo contains the code to facilitate the synthesis, simulation and visualisation of a network of neurons. We can also run the simulation with certain parameters with which we can see in the network the activity concomitant with psychedelic visual patterns. We can also then translate this network activity to receive the retinal image associated with the cortical activity. (This can be found in Network.py)

We can also find in this repo my dissertation which covers the creation and origin of this network, along with various animated plots which could not be put into the dissertation.

Translate.py: A module showing that it is possible to generate from constants from cortical activity aswell as providing a testing grounds for parameter selction to later use this translation feature in the network
Network.py: Contains the network itself
retinal-images-animated: contains some of animated plots of the retinal translation of simulated cortical activity
cortical-activity-live: contains some of the animated cortical activity for simulations
